\opening{\textbf{Dear Miss Berry},}

\textbf{\color{red} As you know, I have rented 41 George Roche Road from you for six months form 15th August. However, I am afraid I will no longer be able to move in on that date, as my plans have had to change because of illness. During the summer vacation,  I was working in a company as a Project Manager. Towards the end of my shift, I slipped and fell on a wet floor and broke my wrist. Luckily, it was a clean break and didn't 
  require surgery. However, it is my right wrist, and so I am unable to write for the time being. At present, I am at home in Kuala Lumpur until the plaster can be taken off - I think this should be in the last week of September. I will then return to my course in Canterbury and take up residence at 41 George Roche Road. I hope this will not cause you any difficulties.}
  
  
\closing{Yours sincerely,}
